# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease is the leading cause of death and hospitalization in the world. Due to technological advancements and the assistance of computer engineering, heart disease may now be quickly and successfully diagnosed and treated. In the realm of medicine nowadays, illness prediction using machine learning is quite popular. According to the Chest and Heart Association of Bangladesh, 25% of all heart strokes in Bangladesh happen in those under 40 and 50% of heart attacks happen to people under 50. The risk of heart attacks is three times higher in urban areas than in rural ones. Our project is regarding heart disease prediction which fall under the category of supervised learning and the dataset is taken from the renowned site- kaggel. Based on data preprocessing and models applied to the dataset, we predicted whether a patient had heart disease or not. Using the provided features, this dataset is intended to identify which patients are most likely to develop a heart disease in the near future.
